<h1>Trigger Diary</h1>
<span>
<h2>Project Description:</h2>
<p>Although this is still a work in progress, this trigger diary will allow users to track every day activities to see if there is a trend that may be influencing and/or triggering their ailment, such as too much caffeine triggering a migraine or too little sleep triggering an epileptic seizure.  It will be combined with the Trigger Tracker once completed, which you can find within my repositories and will be linked shortly.</p>
<p>I have used HTML, CSS, JS, Node, Express, and MongoDB to create this fullstack app.  It is currently hosted on Heroku, but as that will no longer be available for free beginning in November, that will soon be changed.</p>
<p>The current-most project is making a user friendly interface and connecting the two apps (this and the diary mentioned above) together.</p>

<h2>How To Install And Run</h2>
<p>You will need to install npm and express dependencies.  The process to do so will be forthcoming shortly.</p>
